  abstract  = {Oil spills pose severe threats to the environment and climate, impacting marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and air quality. Deep learning emerges as a promising tool for identifying and monitoring oil spills, leveraging machine learning advancements to analyze satellite imagery, and detect spillage patterns accurately. This study focuses on exploring the application of deep learning in understanding oil spill complexities and their implications for climate resilience, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. Our analysis aims to provide insights into existing research methodologies, datasets, and model architectures, shedding light on the potential of deep learning to enhance our understanding of oil spill dynamics. Through an examination of accuracy achieved, geographical contexts, and future directions, we offer valuable insights for leveraging deep learning in mitigating oil spill impacts and fostering environmental stewardship.}
